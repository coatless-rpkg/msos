### Installation

The `msos` package is available on both CRAN and GitHub. The CRAN
version is considered stable while the GitHub version is in a state of
development and may break.

You can install the stable version of the `msos` package with:

``` r
install.packages("msos")
```

For those who like living on the edge, feel free to use a copy of the
development version by doing:

``` r
if(!requireNamespace("remotes")) { install.packages("remotes") }

# Install the package from github
remotes::install_github("coatless/msos")
```
